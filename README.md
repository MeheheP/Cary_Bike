# Cary Bike Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes bicycle safety and infrastructure in Cary, North Carolina, leveraging open data and spatial analysis to identify high-risk areas and recommend ways to make cycling in Cary safer and more accessible. By integrating bike route networks, crash data, parks, eco-counter monitoring, and points of interest, this study provides actionable insights for city planners, cyclists, and the broader public.

##  Major Visualizations

- **Interactive Safety Score Map:**  
  Color-coded bike route segments show safety scores (green = safer, yellow/orange = moderate concern).  
  Additional layers for parks (green markers), eco-counters (purple markers), and community POIs (blue markers).
  Also check out cras_crash_risk map overlayed on bike route .

##  Main Findings & Insights

- Biking risk varies significantly across different route types and areas.
- Routes with higher speed limits, fewer facilities, or proximity to intersections tend to have elevated crash risk.
- Certain parks and neighborhood connectors emerge as safer routes.
- Suggested improvements include targeted infrastructure upgrades in moderate and higher-risk segments, especially where crash clusters were identified.
- Increased eco-counter deployment in under-monitored zones can help direct future safety investments.
- Recommendations are data-driven and designed to support ongoing city planning and safety efforts.
